										<h3><strong>Glassy-winged Sharpshooter
</strong></h3> </header>


<div class="row">


<div class="7u">
<p>Homalodisca vitripennis, aka the glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS), is a xylem feeding leafhopper, invasive to California and an important agricultural pest as a vector of Xylella fastidiosa. As part of my postdoc work with Dr. Jason Stajich, I worked on genome improvements, as well as investigating genomic and microbial mechanisms that might lead to insecticide resistance.

		<p> As part of our genome improvement efforts, we used a combination of Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing technology combined with Illumina sequencing reads to generate an improved assembly and first-pass annotation of the whole genome sequence of a wild-caught Californian (Tulare County) individual of GWSS. This improved genome enabled us to identify orthologous candidate genes of interest for future experimental work including phenotypic marker genes like white. This work also enabled our collaborative CRISPR work and follow-up studies focused on insecticide resistance.  </p>

	<p> Recently wide-spread insecticide resistance has been detected in populations of GWSS in the southern portions of Californiaâ€™s Central Valley. In order to better understand potential mechanisms of resistance, we profiled wild-caught insecticide-resistant and relatively susceptible GWSS transcriptomes. We identified 81 differentially expressed genes with higher expression in resistant individuals, including a highly expressed cytochrome P450 gene with similarity to CYP6A9 that might be a good target for mitigation efforts. We also observed an over-enrichment of GO terms representing functions supportive of roles in resistance mechanisms (cytochrome P450s, M13 peptidases, and cuticle structural proteins).  </p>

				<p> Differentially abundant ASVs linked with GWSS insecticide resistance status. For fungal ASVs, predicted trophic modes are shown as shapes. A positive log2fold change indicates the ASV had higher abundance in insecticide resistant GWSS, while a negative log2fold change indicates it was higher in insecticide-susceptible GWSS.

	<p> While studies have focused on bacterial pathogens or known symbionts of GWSS, little work has been done at the scale of the microbiome (the bacterial community) or mycobiome (the fungal community). We characterized the mycobiome and the microbiome of GWSS across Southern California and explored correlations with captivity and host insecticide resistance status. We found that while the GWSS mycobiome significantly varied across Southern California, the microbiome did not. We also observed a significant difference in both the mycobiome and microbiome between captive and wild GWSS. Finally, we found that the mycobiome, but not the microbiome, was correlated with insecticide resistance status in wild GWSS. Future work should explore the putative link between microbes and insecticide resistance status and investigate whether microbial communities should be considered in GWSS management practices.  </p>
