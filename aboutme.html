										<h3><strong>About me</strong></h3>
									</header>
									<p>I am currently a NSF Ocean Sciences Postdoctoral Fellow in the  <a href="https://microplantpath.ucr.edu/"> Department of Microbiology & Plant Pathology</a> at UC Riverside advised by <a href="http://lab.stajich.org/">Dr. Jason Stajich.</a> With Dr. Stajich, I am currently working on a variety of computational projects (genomic, metagenomic and phylogenomic) at the interface of both host (insect, amphibian, seaweed and seagrass) and microbe (bacteria, fungi, virus) interactions. I received my Ph.D. in <a href="http://igg.ucdavis.edu/"> Integrative Genetics and Genomics </a> at UC Davis in <a href="http://phylogenomics.me/"> Dr. Jonathan Eisen’s </a>laboratory where I studied the seagrass microbiome and seagrass mycobiome. I received my B. A. in Molecular and Cell Biology with a Genetics, Genomics and Development emphasis from UC Berkeley in the spring of 2013. While at UC Berkeley I participated in research in <a href="http://www.simmslab.org/wp/">Dr. Ellen Simms’ </a>lab on multiple projects involving rhizobia-legume symbiosis. My research interests have ranged from sea to summit and encompassed questions related to host-microbiome interactions, host-microbiome coevolution and marine fungi.</p>
									
									<p> In my personal time, I enjoy artistic (ceramics, knitting, baking, photography, graphic design), outdoorsy (mountain biking, paddle-boarding, backpacking, hot yoga), and nerdy (board games, books, tv/movies, video games) pursuits. I love spending time with my cat and dog. </p>
