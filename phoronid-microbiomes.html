										<h3><strong>Phoronid microbiomes
</strong></h3> </header>


<div class="row">


<div class="6u">
<p> Phoronids are a tiny (~12 species) phyla of marine invertebrates that live inside protective chitinous tubes in the sediment. We opportunistically sampled the phoronid, <i>Phoronopsis harmeri</i>, found inside and outside of seagrass beds to investigate their microbiome using high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and metagenomics. </p>

<p>We found that the phoronid microbiome was dominated by members of the orders Campylobacterales, Desulfobulbales, and Desulfobacterales. Despite similarities between abundant taxa associated with tubes, phoronids and surrounding sediment, we detected that each was uniquely structured. We also found that the microbiomes of tubes and phoronids were less diverse than that of surrounding sediment. Overall these results may indicate that phoronid and tube communities are being selected from local sediment microbiomes. Based on analysis of metagenomic data, we recovered low quality MAGs of abundant taxa and found preliminary evidence that taxa associated with phoronids and their tubes likely participate in sulfur cycling pathways.</p>

		<p> Predicted sulfur metabolism profiles. (A) Heatmap showing whether the metagenomic coassembly or individual MAGs had any genes related to each of the different sulfur cycling processes. (B) Summary scheme of the sulfur cycle at the community scale. Each arrow represents a single step within the cycle. Red arrows indicate that the required genes for a step are present in the metagenomic coassembly, while black arrows indicate missing steps. Under each step is a box displaying any MAG(s) found to have the genes needed for that step.
